I'm just screwing around to learn python

I'm making an old-fashioned text-based adventure game.

Actually I haven't started making the adventure.  I'm developing the game engine.  I put some example locations and objects in the game to show how it might work.

I do have a secret notes file with a plan for the actual adventure game that I want this to run.  But right now I'm building a structure to handle objects, locations, and user
commands in a generalized fashion.  The hope is to create something that could be easily used to run multiple text adventure games.
